# Project: RESTy

**Author:** _Waleed A. Afifi_

In this final phase of the RESTy build, we will be adding some more fidelity to the application, including a menu with a ore detailed view of our history, as well as an about us page.

**The following user stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project.**

- As a user, I want to see all of my previous queries as a separate page so that I can browse them in greater detail
- As a user, I would like to view a separate “Help” page so I can learn how the application works
